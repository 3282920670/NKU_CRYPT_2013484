%Today, the complex and ubiquitous software architecture maintains the stability and development of the international society. Compiler technology and high-level programming languages are the cornerstones of these software. Powerful and elegant compilation technology bridges the gap between high-level language and machine language, allowing high-level languages to bring more convenience to programmers. At the same time, understanding the working principle of the compiler will also help improve the programming skills. This paper takes the process of compiling C++ language in GCC compiler under Linux environment as an example, combining the literature and experimental results, to analyze the main workflow of the compiler, in order to have a deeper understanding of the working principle of the compiler. \\
